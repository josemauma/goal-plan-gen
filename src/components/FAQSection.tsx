      question: "How does the app know what plan to create?",
      answer: "We use your goal (lose, gain, or maintain weight), timeline, current fitness level, dietary preferences, and available equipment to generate a personalized plan. Our algorithm is based on proven nutritional science and exercise physiology."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need gym access?",
      answer: "Not at all! We create plans for any situation â€” home workouts with no equipment, basic equipment like dumbbells, or full gym access. Just tell us what you have available."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this suitable for vegetarians/vegans?",
      answer: "Absolutely! We accommodate all dietary preferences including vegetarian, vegan, keto, paleo, and more. Our nutrition guidance adapts to ensure you get complete nutrition regardless of your dietary choices."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is the weight projection?",
      answer: "Our projections are based on scientific metabolic calculations and real user data. While individual results vary, most users reach their goals within 5-10% of our projected timeline when following the plan consistently."
